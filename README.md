ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Aesvan
I'm currently a sophmore pursueing a Computer Science major. I'm mostly uploading small projects and assignments here so I can better keep track of them.

I mostly use Java but I'm interested in learning Python, SQL, Rust, Go... Just about any of them honestly.

Feedback, critiques, etc. are always welcomed.

Have a good rest of your day :)
